## Overview
We present our efforts to construct an open source dataset of Sukkari dates that are sorted
and graded based on market standards. We chose Sukkari dates because of the complexity of their grading
criteria and their widespread availability. This dataset comprises 14,000 images, each sorted
into one of five categories.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

### Raw Dataset:

Sure! Hereâ€™s a rewritten version of your description:

The raw dataset contains all the data collected during our data collection runs, without any preprocessing or cleaning steps applied. Each folder in the dataset is divided into two subfolders: a segmentation data folder and a metadata folder.

- The segmentation data folder includes a series of images saved with the format DateId_ImageType.png. The DateId is an integer representing the date the data was captured, while the ImageType specifies the image modality, which could be one of the following:
  - BGR (color image)
  - NIR900 (near-infrared at 900 nm)
  - NIR970 (near-infrared at 970 nm)
  - Mask (segmentation mask)
- The metadata folder contains additional information, including:
  - Weight data
  - Frame numbers
  - Calibration files 

the raw dataset structure is as follows: 
- Label:
  - run_x:
    - Data: 
      - ID_RGB.png 
      - ID_NIR900.png 
      - ID_NIR970.png 
      - ID_Mask.png 
    - Meta Data 
      - Weight.xlsx 
      - Images.xlsx 
      - Calibration files
      - Notes.txt: 
        - Example: {Label:Galaxy, Date of Collection : %Y-%m-%d %H:%M, Motor 1 Speed: X, Motor 2 Speed: X}

### Clean Dataset:
The clean dataset consist of date images that have been cleaned and preprocessed. 
The date images are ready to be consumed by different AI models and ready for training.
